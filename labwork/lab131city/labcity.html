<b>Vancouver</b> was originally named <b>Gastown</b> and began as a settlement which grew around the site of a makeshift tavern on the western edges of Hastings
 Mill built on July 1, 1867, and owned by proprietor <b>Gassy Jack</b>. The original site is marked by the Gastown steam clock. Gastown then formally 
 registered as a townsite dubbed Granville, Burrard Inlet. The city was renamed "<i>Vancouver</i>" in 1886, through a deal with the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR). 
 The Canadian Pacific transcontinental railway was extended to the city by 1887. The city's large natural seaport on the<b> Pacific Ocean </b>became a vital link in the
 trade between Asia-Pacific, East Asia, Europe, and Eastern Canada
